# resolveS: Resolve RNA-Seq Strand Specificity

The aim is to "Rapid RNA-Seq Strand Specificity Detection".


Accurate determination of strand specificity (stranded vs. non-stranded) is a critical prerequisite for transcriptomic analysis. It is a vital parameter for configuring essential bioinformatics tools like featureCounts and Trinity. However, this information is often missing in public datasets or requires verification in internal analysis.

resolveS is a high-performance tool designed to solve this problem instantly. It is **super-fast, memory-efficient**, and user-friendly, making it the perfect addition to any RNA-Seq Quality Control (QC) pipeline. Whether you are exploring public data or validating your own libraries, resolveS provides the necessary metadata to ensure your downstream analysis is accurate and reproducible.
